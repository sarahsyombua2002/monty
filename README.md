Usage: push <int>
Pushes an element to the stack.
The parameter <int> must be an integer.
pall

Prints all values in the stack/queue, starting from the top.
pint

Prints the top value of the stack/queue.
pop

Removes the top element of the stack/queue.
swap

Swaps the top two elements of the stack/queue.
nop

Does not do anything.
add

Adds the top two elements of the stack/queue.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is popped.
sub

Subtracts the top element of the stack/queue from the second element from the top.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
mul

Multiplies the top two elements of the stack/queue.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
div

Divides the second element from the top of the stack/queue by the top element.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
mod

Computes the modulus of the second element from the top of the stack/queue divided by the top element.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
pchar

Prints the character value of the top element of the stack/queue.
The integer at the top is treated as an ASCII value.
pstr

Prints the string contained in the stack/queue.
Prints characters element by element until the stack/queue is empty, a value is 0, or an error occurs.
rotl

Rotates the top element of the stack/queue to the bottom.
rotr

Rotates the bottom element of the stack/queue to the top.
stack
