*Group project*
*Algorithm*

**Data structure**

**By: Julien Barbier**
 *Weight: 2*

**Project to be done in teams of 2 people (your team: James Mutua, Sarah Mutethya)**

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

**General**

What do LIFO and FIFO mean
What is a stack, and when to use it
What is a queue, and when to use it
What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
What is the proper way to use global variables

**Requirements**

**General**

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
No more than 5 functions per file
You are allowed to use the C standard library
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project

**What to expect on the project**

push

Usage: push <int>
Pushes an element to the stack.
The parameter <int> must be an integer.
pall

Prints all values in the stack/queue, starting from the top.
pint

Prints the top value of the stack/queue.
pop

Removes the top element of the stack/queue.
swap

Swaps the top two elements of the stack/queue.
nop

Does not do anything.
add

Adds the top two elements of the stack/queue.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is popped.
sub

Subtracts the top element of the stack/queue from the second element from the top.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
mul

Multiplies the top two elements of the stack/queue.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
div

Divides the second element from the top of the stack/queue by the top element.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
mod

Computes the modulus of the second element from the top of the stack/queue divided by the top element.
The result is stored in the second element from the top and the top element is removed.
pchar

Prints the character value of the top element of the stack/queue.
The integer at the top is treated as an ASCII value.
pstr

Prints the string contained in the stack/queue.
Prints characters element by element until the stack/queue is empty, a value is 0, or an error occurs.
rotl

Rotates the top element of the stack/queue to the bottom.
rotr

Rotates the bottom element of the stack/queue to the top.
stack

Switches a queue to stack mode.
queue

Switches a stack to queue mode.
